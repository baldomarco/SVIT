# SVIT

Satellite Vegetation Indices Trend (SVIT) is an Algorithm created by the Ph.D. candidate Baldo Marco to analyze the forest changes in terms of cover and productivity. 
Thanks to the support of PhD Piero Zannini, PhD Kurian Ayushi and the Full Professor Duccio Rocchini, we create an R script to analyze the 
Dry Matter Productivity, Fraction of Absorbed Photosintetically Active Radiation and Normalized Different Vegetation Index trends of a selected area, in this case study over 
the central Western Ghats world Biodiversity Hotspot and more detailed in the Uppangala district. To realized it we used the theory of the multispectral bands analysis and multiple time series analysis using different level of resolution.
