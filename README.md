# SVIT

Satellite Vegetation Indices Trend (SVIT) is an Algorithm created by Ph.D. candidate Baldo Marco to analyse the forest changes in terms of cover and productivity. 
Thanks to the support of Piero Zannini PhD, Kurian Ayushi PhD, and Full Professor Duccio Rocchini PhD, we created an R script to analyse the 
Dry Matter Productivity, Fraction of Absorbed Photosynthetically Active Radiation and Normalized Different Vegetation Index trends of a selected area, in this case, study over 
the central Western Ghats world Biodiversity Hotspot and more detailed in the Uppangala district. To realise it, we used the theory of the multispectral bands' analysis and multiple time series analysis using different levels of resolution.
