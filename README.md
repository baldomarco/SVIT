# SVIT

Satellite Vegetation Indices Trend (SVIT) is an algorithm structure created by the Ph.D. candidate Baldo Marco, MSc to analyse the forest changes in terms of cover and productivity. 
Thanks to the support of Piero Zannini, PhD, Kurian Ayushi, PhD, and Full Professor Duccio Rocchini, PhD, has been elaborated an R script to analyse the 
Dry Matter Productivity, Fraction of Absorbed Photosynthetically Active Radiation and Normalized Different Vegetation Index trends of a selected area, in this case, study over the Central Western Ghats global biodiversity hotspot and more detailed with the Kadamakal Reserve Forest and Pushpagiri Wildlife Sanctuary borders. To realise it, we used the theory of the multispectral bands analysis and multiple time series analysis using different levels of resolution and vegetation indices related to primary productivity, photosynthesis and healty vegetation reflectance.
